Hi Family!

Just wanted to send out an email update from our trip, since we aren't currently on social media.

We have been in San Miguel de Allende for five days, and starting to feel somewhat settled in our home.  Chris has been to the big grocery store La Comer twice, which is like any grocery store you'd find in the US, with a little cafe in it.  So, we've got all the basics (food/toiletries) for the next week or so.  We've gotten TACOS a couple times, and found a realllly good place in town that is so yummy.  I'll include a picture Chris took of the guy cutting meat off a big stick thing.  I'm not sure what kind of meat it was...but it was good.

Chris's work is going well.  The internet is strong enough and he's set up a make-shift desk with an ironing board... He says he's had a productive week, so far.

The kids are having a great time swimming in the neighborhood pool every day while Mina naps.  They get their school work done first thing in the morning, so they can be free to play for the rest of the day.  Mina still hasn't adjusted to sleeping well here, but she rarely sleeps well anyways.  ;) She had a little cold when we arrived, and is much better today.  I think maybe she's teething as well.  We have netflix in the living room, so she can watch Sesame Street and the kids can watch movies in the evenings.

There is a sweet orange kitty that visits us every day.  Petra is calling him Ginger.

Oh, and I made a friend!  Her name is Deify (Day-fee), and she and her husband Daniel and toddler Joaquín (Wa-keen) live in our neighborhood.  She invited me to a moms' group in town on Monday afternoon, and is going to send me a list of fun things to do with kids nearby.  Our landlord is a really sweet and helpful lady named Lupita.

I took all three kids (without Chris!) to town on Monday, and was surprised to find out it was a special holiday... lots and lots of tourists and Mexicans were in town and I was overwhelmed and hot.  We found a little restaurant in an inner patio garden and had some delicious smoothies for about $2 each.  Kids loved them!

We are planning to take the bus to town today for the first time--with Chris this time--and check out a big indoor market.  There are lots of shops and little restaurants inside, so we'll grab dinner there... I'm in the mood for enchiladas!

The weather is pretty nice here--it's chilly in the mornings and night and hot in the afternoon (upper 70's).  Just warm enough to swim. =)  And thankfully, the house is always a comfortable temperature.  We haven't spotted any hummingbirds, unfortunately, despite hanging a feeder in the window.  The only birds we've seen around the house are Mexican Grackles--like our Grackles, but they have a super long tail (also called the Great-Tailed Grackle).  We also saw a cute lime-colored bird bathing in a fountain in town, outside of a very fancy hotel called the Rosewood. Not many bugs spotted!

A pressing goal we have is to find a place to do our laundry--we don't have a way to do it here...besides manually.  I hand-washed some clothes today and I don't want to do that all the time.

I'll send out a weeklyish email like this one to you all to keep you posted on our time here!

xoxo Love you all!
