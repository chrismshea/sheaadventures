Hi everyone!

We made it to El Charco Botanical Garden here in San Miguel de Allende.  It was a sunny, dry morning.. like every morning.  The trip there was a longer than the return.  We took a bus for 37 cents to town, then got off at a market.  While we waiting for an uber (taxi) to come pick us up and take us to El Charco, I ordered some interesting looking tacos.  I asked if they were chicken or steak, and the waiter pointed to a picture of a ram.  I think it was sheep meat.  Anyways, I walked back to the family a ways away and took a bite.  I looked back and saw that the waiter was watching me, so I smiled, took another bite, and gave him a thumbs up!

Then I realized my mouth was full of bone bits.  Blah!  The waiter was still watching, so I leisurely walked around the corner--trying not to gag--then spit the crunchy mouthful out into a a napkin.  I'm getting queasy remembering it.

Then I gave the rest of the tacos to Chris.  He ate them without complaint... and shared the tortilla part with Mina.  She begged for more, saying Tacos! on the drive to the botanical garden.

Once there, we payed the entrance fee ($2 each for Chris and I, kids free) and ordered a much tastier breakfast.  We shared a spinach and cheese omelette, a bowl of fruit with papayas, bananas, apples, yogurt, honey and granola (yum!), and a big glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.  That made me feel so much better!

We wandered around only a portion of El Charco before we decided the sun was too strong to keep exploring.  There was a nice little playground area with a slide and we also found a hidden shaded patch with a swing on our way down to a reservoir.  We saw some migrating birds (we didn't identify them, but some were black ducks with white bills).  The dusty trail was surrounded in cactus plants, and lots of humming birds buzzed around!  Petra selected a sweet little cactus to purchase for 80 pesos ($4).  We hired a car for $4 to take us straight home from there, and had a pretty relaxed Sunday afternoon.

Oh!--exciting news--we decided to stay another month!  We've rented a 2 bedroom condo in another gated complex across the main road from us.  There is a pool there and a little garden patio area, so hopefully we'll all be as content there as we are here.  (Our current place is unavailable next month).  We don't have any great interest in rushing back to Vermont in March, burr.  Plus, Henrik is happy to extend his break from school, and he's doing really well homeschooling with Petra.  Mina seems especially happy here!  Everyone is doing well.

Congrats to Chris R-P on the new business!!!  Hope you had a great birthday, brother.

Love to all!  Have a great week.
