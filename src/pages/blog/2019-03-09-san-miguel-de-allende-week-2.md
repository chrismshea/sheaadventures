Hi everyone!

I had such a nice time with Henrik and Petra this afternoon.  We took an Uber (hired car) to the public library.  There was amazing art everywhere--paintings on ceilings, sculptures and paintings--and I loved the stone walls and floors. The first book I saw was one titled My Name is Mina and I Love the Night. It was the only one sitting on a large table as we entered the children's area.  I found this coincidental because I have had this book in my amazon cart for months!

After reading a bit, we went to the cafe inside the library.  It was really pretty, in a garden with a large tree and little House Sparrows hopping around.  We got chocolate cake, cheese cake and delicious hot chocolates.  The kids and I had such a fun time together.

So.. we've gotten our laundry done once!  It was a little stressful because our laundry was returned a day late.. so for one night, we thought maybe it wasn't ever coming back!  Thankfully, I found out yesterday that a laundry service actually comes to our neighborhood twice per week, so we'll probably use them next.

We visited our friends last Sunday and had a nice evening together.  The kids enjoyed playing with their friend's switch video game.

Kids are keeping up with all their school work.  This has been especially advantageous for Petra because she is learning to use the educational computer games that Henrik uses.  She's doing much more math work these days!

We hope to go to to El Charco Botanical Gardens today or tomorrow afternoon.  I believe it's a pretty dry place with lots of cactus and a small playground area.

Here are some pics from today's excursion with the big kids!

Love you all!
