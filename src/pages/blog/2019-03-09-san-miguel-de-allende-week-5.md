Hi Family!

We moved!  But, just across the street.  We are now in a neighborhood called Los Frailes, and I think we have the smallest home in here.  Some of our neighbors live in actual castles.  CASTLES.  I'll get a pic of the nearest one soon.  Anyways, it's a lovely area with little parks and cobble stone streets, eventually leading down to a big lake.  We have a great restaurant in walking distance, with a big open air patio and very good sandwiches.  Our new apartment is small and cozy... well, it was a little pet-hairy to begin with, but Chris Shea has been Chris Shea-ing it, and we had the couch covers professionally washed.  I'm currently seated on the couch, and not feeling like my sinuses are miserable for the first time.  Yay!

We also have a pool here, and there is a baby pool for Mina!  So, that's wonderful.  There is a shady, fern-shrouded covered patio near the pool that is an inspiring spot to meditate, day-dream or write.  I've decided to brush the cobwebs off an old novel in the making--one I started in Costa Rica.  I did some writing yesterday from this mini-oasis while Mina napped, and it felt marvelous.

We have done a little more wandering in town, but we prefer to stick to our favorite spots.  We found a butterfly garden in Parque Juarez (did I tell you that already?).  Anyways, it was sooo pretty and peaceful, and we did see several Monarchs.  Nearby is our favorite go-to restaurant, Consentido.  We have been there maybe five times now, and it's always a hit.  The kids love the play area and Chris and I love the fish tacos!

There is also an artisan market right outside of Consentido each weekend.  Last weekend, the kids went with their savings (about 200 pesos/$10 each) and selected some hand-crafted, brightly painted wooden animals. Henrik chose a little antelope (see pic) and Petra picked a hummingbird.

I took Henrik and Petra to the dentist this morning--what a successful adventure!  We walked all the way to the bus stop (which is now much further than it used to be..probably now a 20 minute walk).  Then, we waited on the main highway until a bus showed up.  I was so relieved to see it, because we were running out of time, so I told the kids if it didn't show up in 4 minutes, we'd have to walk all the way to the dentist (another 20 minutes).  Two minutes later--there was the bus!  And instead of the usual route that takes us to the grocery store and on into the center of town, this bus actually turned into the neighborhood we needed to go to!  It practically dropped us off at the door of our dentist!

The kids were very well behaved for their dental cleanings and fluoride treatments.  They each had a tv attached to the chair and requested particular shows they wanted (Puppy Dog Pals for P and Ninjago for H).  The dentist was sweet and spoke English.  It all went smoothly.  $18 each.  Dog and sword-shaped balloons included. This costs us $118 each in Vermont, and no balloons.  I made an appointment for myself next week, with Petra too because one of her fillings fell out and needs to be replaced ($20).

This afternoon, I'm thinking about taking the kids to Tacos El Pata, one of their favorite places.  There is a huge tunnel and slide-filled play area, with a little ball pit for Mina.  $1 tacos, but they aren't very good.  The kids like a special drink there though, called rompope.

Speaking of tacos, Chris and I decided we had the best tacos ever last night... at home!  We got a rotisserie chicken and some fresh flour tortillas at the grocery store for about $5 total.  We added some freshly chopped onion, avocado and tomatoes and it was heavenly.  I don't think we can recreate this anywhere else, because the chicken had a unique and delightful flavor.  Hopefully not MSG.  ;)

Kids and I are beginning to miss home. (Not Chris--I think he could stay here another year).  Petra was riding in the grocery cart last night, and as we rolled past the cat food aisle, she sighed, "I miss Inga."  I understand.  I miss Iver, and even Romeo too, a little bit.

And I miss you all!  Can't wait to see the Marylanders in a few weeks and hopefully Laura someday soon.  We are going to book our flights tonight or tomorrow.  It'll either be March 23rd or 30th, depending on cost/flight duration, etc.  Our apartment is paid for until April 2nd.

Love love love.

P.S.  Thanks to Chris and Simi for changing the cat litter and vacuuming downstairs!  And thanks, Mom, for having Romeo groomed!

And here's a ton of pictures!
