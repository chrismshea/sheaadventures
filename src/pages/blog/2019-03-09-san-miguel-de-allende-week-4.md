Hi guys!

We are enjoying the spring that has just arrived in Mexico.  Flowers are starting to bloom, and it looks like a pair of birds (perhaps Kiskadees) are planning to nest in a nearby tree.  There is a lemon tree that I pass every day on the way to our neighborhood pool, and it's now covered in sweet-smelling blossoms.

I took the kids to a café last week with a roof top terrace.  We ate delicious chocolate and carrot cake muffins and had warm drinks.  That morning, we also explored the interior of the light pink church in the center of town.  It's called the Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel.  It has painted domed ceilings and lots of chandeliers.  We aren't allowed to take photos inside, so hopefully the kids will carry a glimpse of it in their memory.  I took a few photos of the outside, though!

Another day, I went in to town with Henrik and Petra and checked out a toy museum, Museo La Esquina del Jugete Popular Mexico.  (Museum on the Corner of Popular Mexican Toys).  So many colorful, hand-painted wooden pieces!  The kids wandered around, intrigued, and were really excited to find the exact toy I'd recently purchased at a market for $2!  It's a wooden paddle with some chickens, with and a ball hanging from it.  You circle the paddle around a bit, and the chickens peck away!

We found out yesterday that there is a butterfly garden in the big park in town (Parque Juarez).  It's a nice shady place that we stroll through sometimes, so I'll try to find this garden soon.  The last time we walked through, Petra found a large patch of fresh rosemary.

Oh, and we found the best place for fish tacos!  It's a restaurant called Consentido, and it has a large section devoted to kids--the play area has chalkboards, a ball pit, a tv with cartoons and bean bag chairs.  The kids made friends with a family from California yesterday, with four daughters.

Speaking of friends, we went to a party last Saturday!  Some friends from Costa Rica hosted a 40th birthday party and we got to meet a lot of other gringo families.  Henrik played video games and Petra and Mina danced under a disco ball. =)  It was nice to mingle with so many nice people, who all seem to be very happy here.

This is our final week in our current neighborhood.  On Saturday, we move across the street to another upscale community.  I'm looking forward to the change, and also looking forward to returning home by the end of March.  I guess we'll still have some snow waiting for us in Vermont!

Love you all so much!
